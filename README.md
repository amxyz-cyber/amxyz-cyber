- 👋 Hi, I’m @amxyz-cyber
- 👀 I’m interested in recompiling programs / libraries written in C++, Java, Haskell or Python, i.e. updating programs by changing the dependencies or extendening the features. What's more, I'd like to write programs for the Raspberry Pi.
- 🌱 I possess enhanced knowledge of Linux. That's why I'm interested in automating stuff on this operating system using Bash scripting or Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Java projects, Haskell projects or on any other project that involves visualizing the data of test series.
- 📫 How to reach me: macrolab@posteo.net
