- 👋 Hi, I’m @amxyz-cyber
- 🌱 I possess enhanced knowledge of Linux. That's why I'd like to automate stuff on this operating system using Bash scripting or Python.
- 👀 I’m interested in recompiling programs / libraries written in C++, Java, Haskell or Python, i.e. updating programs by changing the dependencies or extendening the features. What's more, I'd like to write programs for the Raspberry Pi.
- 👀 I’m interested in solving problems from natural sciences using computer simulation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Java projects, Haskell projects or on any other project that involves visualizing the data of test series.
- 🌱 I’m studying chemistry as a major on a bachelor's degree at an Austrian University.
